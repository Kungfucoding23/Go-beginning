/*Switch
A switch statement is a shorter way to write a sequence of if - else statements. It runs the first case whose value is equal to the condition expression.

Go's switch is like the one in C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and PHP, except that Go only runs the selected case, not all the cases that follow. In effect, the break statement that is needed at the end of each case in those languages is provided automatically in Go. Another important difference is that Go's switch cases need not be constants, and the values involved need not be integers.*/

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"runtime"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Print("Go is runing on ")
	switch os := runtime.GOOS; os {
	case "darwin":
		fmt.Println("OS X.")
	case "linux":
		fmt.Println("Linux")
	default:
		// freebsd, openbsd,
		// plan9, windows...
		fmt.Printf("%s.\n", os)
	}
	when()

	greeting()

	aplazar()

	stack()
}

func when() {
	fmt.Println("WhenÂ´s Saturday?")
	today := time.Now().Weekday()
	fmt.Println("Today is", today)
	switch time.Saturday {
	case today + 0:
		fmt.Println("Today.")
	case today + 1:
		fmt.Println("Tomorrow.")
	case today + 2:
		fmt.Println("In two days.")
	default:
		fmt.Println("Saturday is too far away.")
	}
}

/*Switch with no condition
Switch without a condition is the same as switch true.

This construct can be a clean way to write long if-then-else chains.*/

func greeting() {
	t := time.Now()
	switch {
	case t.Hour() < 12:
		fmt.Println("Good morning!")
	case t.Hour() < 17:
		fmt.Println("Good afternoon")
	default:
		fmt.Println("Good evening!")
	}
}

/*Defer
A defer statement defers the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns.

The deferred call's arguments are evaluated immediately, but the function call is not executed until the surrounding function returns.*/

func aplazar() {
	defer fmt.Println("world")

	fmt.Println("Hello")
}

/*Stacking defers
Deferred function calls are pushed onto a stack. When a function returns, its deferred calls are executed in last-in-first-out order.

To learn more about defer statements read this blog post.*/

func stack() {
	fmt.Println("Counting")

	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		defer fmt.Println(i)
	}

	fmt.Println("done")
}
